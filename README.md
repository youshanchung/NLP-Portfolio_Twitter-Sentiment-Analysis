Codecademy's NLP career path final project

For those of you who are not familary with "Codecademy's NLP career path," this is a course that teaches the fundamentals of general data science and NLP skills, knowledge I used to create this project. 

I used "clean_nus_sms.csv" as provided by Codecademy and followed the analysis of the solution. That means I look at the solution first, try to understand it, and reproduce it, using my own variables. 

I model my analysis after the solution mainly because, first, it uses Pandas functions I didn't know, I think I can get familar with them by actually using them in this project, and second, as a beginnger,  some baseline like the solution help me see the structure of this kind of analysis and where I should work more on. 

As for the NLP part, I think the solution's model, i.e. Naive Bayes is straightforward while not obsolete,  I decided to follow suit as I can't really handle multiple Pandas functions and deep learning at once.
